  "description": "A classic Ethiopian feast featuring injera, a sourdough flatbread made from teff flour, served with spicy chicken stew. The injera's unique tangy flavor and spongy texture perfectly complements the rich, complex flavors of doro wat, which is considered Ethiopia's national dish. The key to its distinctive taste lies in berbere spice blend and niter kibbeh (spiced clarified butter), creating a dish that exemplifies the sophisticated flavors of Ethiopian cuisine.",

The name translates to 'Jansson's Temptation,' reportedly named after a food-loving opera singer.

The result is a luxurious dish that epitomizes Swedish comfort food and has remained a beloved staple on Swedish tables for generations.",

    { "stepNumber": 2, "description": "In a large Dutch oven or heavy pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add leeks, fennel, and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened but not browned, about 8-10 minutes." },
    { "stepNumber": 3, "description": "Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in tomatoes with their juices, orange zest, saffron, bay leaves, and thyme sprigs." },
    { "stepNumber": 4, "description": "Pour in the fish stock and white wine. Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat to maintain a simmer. Cook uncovered for 20 minutes to allow flavors to meld." },
    { "stepNumber": 5, "description": "Meanwhile, prepare the rouille: In a food processor, combine garlic, roasted red pepper, breadcrumbs, egg yolk, saffron with its soaking liquid, and lemon juice. Pulse until smooth. With the machine running, gradually add olive oil in a thin stream until the mixture thickens like mayonnaise. Season with salt and set aside." },
    { "stepNumber": 6, "description": "After the broth has simmered for 20 minutes, season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. If using, add the Pernod or Pastis." },

    { "stepNumber": 8, "description": "Remove bay leaves and thyme sprigs. Taste broth and adjust seasoning if necessary." },
    { "stepNumber": 9, "description": "To serve traditionally: Ladle some broth into soup bowls, then arrange the seafood and vegetables on a separate platter. Allow diners to help themselves to the seafood and pour additional broth over it. Alternatively, you can place seafood and vegetables directly into individual bowls and ladle broth over them." },
    { "stepNumber": 10, "description": "Garnish with reserved fennel fronds. Serve immediately with toasted baguette slices spread with rouille." }

  "notes": [
    "Authentic bouillabaisse should include at least three different types of fish typical of the Mediterranean. Traditional choices include red mullet, sea robin, and European conger.",
    "For the best flavor, make your own fish stock by simmering fish bones with aromatics, or ask your fishmonger for fish trimmings to make the stock.",
    "The saffron is essential to achieve the distinctive flavor and golden color of a true bouillabaisse.",
    "In Marseille, the broth is traditionally served separately from the seafood, with diners adding the seafood to their bowls as desired.",
    "While Pernod or Pastis adds an authentic touch, you can omit it if unavailable or not to your taste."

  "notes": [
    "Traditional German spätzle makers (spätzlehobel) make the process easier, but a colander with large holes or even a cheese grater can work in a pinch.",
    "The batter should be between a thick batter and a soft dough - it should slowly fall from a spoon but hold its shape somewhat.",
    "For variation, you can add a handful of cooked and crumbled bacon to the layers.",
    "Mountain cheeses like Bergkäse or Allgäuer Emmentaler are traditional, but any good melting cheese can be substituted.",
    "In some regions, a small amount of sautéed leeks or spinach is added between the layers for additional flavor and color."
