  "instructions": [
    { "stepNumber": 1, "description": "Prepare the bones and meat: Rinse the beef bones thoroughly under cold water. Place in a large stockpot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil and cook for 5 minutes to remove impurities." },
    { "stepNumber": 2, "description": "Drain the bones and rinse the pot. Return the bones to the clean pot with the beef chuck or brisket. Add 6 quarts of cold water and bring to a gentle simmer." },
    { "stepNumber": 3, "description": "Char the aromatics: Place the halved onions and sliced ginger cut-side down on a baking sheet. Broil until charred, about 5 minutes, or char directly over a gas flame using tongs. Add to the stockpot." },
    { "stepNumber": 4, "description": "Prepare the spices: In a dry skillet over medium heat, toast the star anise, cinnamon, coriander seeds, fennel seeds, cloves, and cardamom pods until fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. Transfer to a spice bag or wrap in cheesecloth and secure with kitchen twine." },
    { "stepNumber": 5, "description": "Add the spice packet to the stockpot. Simmer, partially covered, for 3 hours, occasionally skimming off any foam or fat that rises to the surface." },
    { "stepNumber": 6, "description": "After 1.5 hours, remove the beef chuck or brisket pieces when tender. Allow to cool, then thinly slice and set aside for serving." },
    { "stepNumber": 7, "description": "Continue simmering the broth for the remaining time. After 3 hours total, remove the bones, spice packet, onions, and ginger from the broth and discard." },
    { "stepNumber": 8, "description": "Season the broth with fish sauce, rock sugar, and salt to taste. The broth should be a balance of savory, slightly sweet, and aromatic." },
    { "stepNumber": 9, "description": "Keep the broth at a low simmer while preparing the remaining components." },
    { "stepNumber": 10, "description": "Prepare the noodles: Cook the rice noodles according to package instructions until just tender. Drain and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking process." },
    { "stepNumber": 11, "description": "Prepare the fresh toppings: Arrange the bean sprouts, Thai basil, lime wedges, and sliced chilies on a platter for serving." },
    { "stepNumber": 12, "description": "Place the raw sirloin slices on a separate plate. The meat should be sliced as thinly as possible (partially freezing it first can help with this)." },
    { "stepNumber": 13, "description": "Assemble the pho: Divide the cooked noodles among 6 large, deep soup bowls. Top each with some of the cooked beef and several slices of raw sirloin." },
    { "stepNumber": 14, "description": "Ladle the hot broth directly over the raw beef to cook it partially. Top with sliced green onions, white onion, and cilantro." },
    { "stepNumber": 15, "description": "Serve immediately, allowing each person to customize their bowl with bean sprouts, herbs, lime juice, chilies, hoisin sauce, and sriracha according to their preference." }

  "notes": [
    "The depth of flavor in pho comes from properly charring the onions and ginger, which adds a subtle smoky sweetness to the broth.",
    "Blanching the bones before making the broth helps remove impurities and results in a clearer final product.",
    "For an authentic touch, some cooks add a small piece of Chinese rock sugar to the broth, but regular sugar works as well.",
    "The key to properly cooked rice noodles is to slightly undercook them, as they'll continue to soften in the hot broth.",
    "Traditional pho is served with the raw beef on top, which gently cooks in the hot broth. If preferred, you can fully cook all the beef before serving."
